# Ninjas VS Pirates!

This was an assignment for my course but I had such a good time with it, I decided to put it here. Below are the rules, I hope you enjoy!

<h2>RULES</h2>
<p>The game will ask for the name of player 1 and what team they prefer to be on: Ninjas or Pirates<br>
Player 2 will type in their name and be assigned the opposite team of player 1<br>
The game then shows you each player's stats for a few seconds and then it starts!<br>
Currently the game has 5 options each turn: Attack, Buff Attack, Agility (buff speed), Heal (2 times per player per game), Buff Defense, and Special Attack<br>
Enter the number corresponding to the option you want to use<br>
Each player only gets 2 Heals per game<br>
There is a small chance of a critical hit when attacking<br>
When buffing defense, your stat may be boosted by a little or by a lot, depending on your luck!<br>
There is a Special Attack for each player now!<br>
Pirates can use their scurvy to their advantage and cough on Ninjas!<br>
Ninjas use an ancient art and throw a shuriken at Pirates!<br>
Special Attacks do more damage than normal attacks!
