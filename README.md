# Ninjas VS Pirates!

This was an assignment for my course but I had such a good time with it, I decided to put it here. Below are the rules, I hope you enjoy!

RULES\n
The game will ask for the name of player 1 and what team they prefer to be on: Ninjas or Pirates\n
Player 2 will type in their name and be assigned the opposite team of player 1\n
The game then shows you each player's stats for a few seconds and then it starts!\n
Currently the game has 5 options each turn: Attack, Buff Attack, Agility (buff speed), Heal (2 times per player per game), and Buff Defense\n
Enter the number corresponding to the option you want to use\n
Each player only gets 2 Heals per game\n
There is a small chance of a critical hit when attacking\n
When buffing defense, your stat may be boosted by a little or by a lot, depending on your luck!\n
